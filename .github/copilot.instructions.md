# Project coding standards

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use tailwind CSS for styling
- Use prop-types for runtime type checking of props
- Redux for state management
- Use Redux Toolkit for creating slices and reducers

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
